# Anime Watchlist

This project is a simple web application that lets the user keep track of anime titles.  
It allows you to type in an anime name on the webpage and save it into a MySQL database.  
The saved anime titles are then shown on the screen in a table.  
I am building the project in small steps, and updating each version.
